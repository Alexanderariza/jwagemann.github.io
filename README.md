## jwagemann.github.io

This repo hosts my personal website [jwagemann.github.io](https://jwagemann.github.io) via GitHub pages. The Jekyll template is [AcademicPages](https://academicpages.github.io/), which was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. 

I modified the template to my needs. Please feel free to fork this modified version.
