Hi, I am Julia and I am a <font color='#2aa198'>geospatial data consultant, PhD candidate and community builder</font> on a mission to make open meteorological, climate and atmospheric data better accessible. My work is in the intersection between data users and data providers. I am a strong believer in the leverage of open-source geospatial software and in bringing different Earth Science communities together in order to make the best use of open geospatial data.<br>
You can find me on Twitter [@JuliaWagemann](https://twitter.com/JuliaWagemann), [GitHub](https://github.com/jwagemann) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-wagemann-99308b86/).

- Geospatial data consultant
------
I do consultancy work on open geospatial data and software. 
	- I am the coordinator of the [ECMWF Summer of Weather Code (ESoWC)](https://github.com/esowc) programme, an online coding programme to develop weather-related open-source software. 
	- In collaboration with EUMETSAT and MEEO s.r.l., I am developing LTPy, a series of Jupyter-based notebooks for atmospheric composition data. I run [tutorials and workshops](/talks), mainly on the interactive analysis of large volumes of Earth Observation data, with Jupyter notebooks, Python and R. 
	- I am currently collaborating with the team of Google Earth Engine to make a subset of the climate reanalysis [ERA5 dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) from Copernicus accessible via the Google Earth Engine platform.

- PhD research
------
I pursue a [PhD at the Faculty of Geography at University of Marburg](http://vhrz669.hrz.uni-marburg.de/lcrs/content_subprojects.do?phase=1&subpage=aims&subprojectid=1013), in collaboration with ECMWF. My research is in the interface of open climate and meteorological data, user requirements, Big data technologies and cloud computing. I am interested how big data technologies, such as Apache Spark or dask, can be leveraged in order to provide efficient geospatial data services on the cloud.

- Community builder
------
I initiated the [Women in Geospatial network](http://twitter.com/geospatialwomen), a professional network for women in the geospatial domain to promote gender diversity in the geospatial field.
I am a co-founder and currently the 1st board member of the NGO [Glocal LifeLearn e.V.](https://glocal-lifelearn.org). We are supporting education initiatives worldwide, aiming to give disadvantaged children access to education. 
In 2017, I was one of the main organisers of the [OpenDataHack @ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/learning/workshops/opendatahack-ecmwf-beyond-weather-explore-creative-uses-open-data). A weekend-long hackathon putting open data from Copernicus and ECMWF in the spotlight.
