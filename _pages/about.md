Hi, I am Julia and I am a <font color='#2aa198'>geospatial data consultant, PhD candidate and community builder</font> on a mission to make open meteorological, climate and atmospheric data better accessible. My work is in the intersection between data users and data providers. I am a strong believer in the leverage of open-source geospatial software and in bringing different Earth Science communities together in order to make the best use of open geospatial data.<br>
You can find me on Twitter [@JuliaWagemann](https://twitter.com/JuliaWagemann), [GitHub](https://github.com/jwagemann) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-wagemann/).

- Geospatial data consultant
------
I do consultancy work on open geospatial data and software and user engagement and I run regular [workshops](/talks), mainly on interactive (geo-)spatial data analysis, with Jupyter notebooks, Python and R.<br>
Projects I have been working on recently:<br>
- Program lead - [ECMWF Summer of Weather Code (ESoWC)](https://github.com/esowc) programme, an online coding programme to develop weather-related open-source software.<br>
- Main developer and content lead - **Learning Tool for Python (LTPy) on Atmospheric Composition Data**, a series of Jupyter notebooks for atmsospheric composition data, including Sentinel-5p, Sentinel-3, GOME-2, IASI and CAMS. *(in collaboration with <a href="https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/index.html" target="_blank">EUMETSAT</a> and <a href="http://www.meeo.it/wp/" target="_blank">MEEO s.r.l.</a>)*<br>
- Developer - **Development of practical tutorials and How-To Guides** for <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/" target="_blank">Copernicus Climate Data Store Toolbox</a>. *(in collaboration with <a href="http://www.bopen.it/" target="_blank">B-Open Solutions</a>, <a href="http://sabrinaszeto.com/" target="_blank">Sabrina Szeto Consulting</a> and EJQ-Quartz)*<br>
- Main developer and project lead - [ERA5 in Google Earth Engine](https://github.com/jwagemann/era5_in_gee) - Made a subset of the Copernicus climate reanalysis [ERA5 dataset](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) available as part of <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_DAILY" target="__blank">Google Earth Engine's public data catalog</a>.

- PhD research
------
I pursue a [PhD at the Faculty of Geography at University of Marburg](http://vhrz669.hrz.uni-marburg.de/lcrs/content_subprojects.do?phase=1&subpage=aims&subprojectid=1013), in collaboration with ECMWF. My research is in the interface of open climate and meteorological data, user requirements, Big data technologies and cloud computing. I am interested how big data technologies, such as Apache Spark or dask, can be leveraged in order to provide efficient geospatial data services on the cloud.

- Community builder
------
I initiated the [Women in Geospatial network](http://twitter.com/geospatialwomen), a professional network for women in the geospatial domain to promote gender diversity in the geospatial field.
I am a co-founder and currently the 1st board member of the NGO [Glocal LifeLearn e.V.](https://glocal-lifelearn.org). We are supporting education initiatives worldwide, aiming to give disadvantaged children access to education. 
In 2017, I was one of the main organisers of the [OpenDataHack @ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/learning/workshops/opendatahack-ecmwf-beyond-weather-explore-creative-uses-open-data). A weekend-long hackathon putting open data from Copernicus and ECMWF in the spotlight.
