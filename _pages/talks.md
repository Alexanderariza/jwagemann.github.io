Throughout the year, I attend geospatial conferences where I run workshops on geospatial data analysis or give presentations on open meteorological and climate data and my PhD research. You find a selection of the most recent workshops / conference talks below.


Workshops
------
**Upcoming** <br>
- [Accessing and processing atmospheric composition data with Python and Jupyter notebooks](https://atmostraining.info/)<br>*First Joint Training Course on Atmospheric Composition - Cluj-Napoca, Romania - 4-8 November 2019*<br>Two practical sessions introduced course participants to different types of atmospheric composition data from AC-SAF, Sentinel-5P and CAMS and gave hands-on examples how the data can be handled, processed and visualized with Python.
